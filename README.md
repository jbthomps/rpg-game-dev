# RPG dev project

This is a prototype heavy project whose focus is building out most of a backbone of an old-school turn based rpg manually in Angular. Right now, this project does not include a directly executable build, and would require building it as a developer.  In order to do this, you'll need to install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/).

## Setup (super basic)
Once you have installed nodeJS, you'll want to install Git, then [clone this repoistory](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/setting-up-a-repository/git-clone).  This will allow you to more easily update the repository later.<br/>
After you have done that, you can bring up a command prompt (on Windows, you can search for cmd), and navigate to the folder where you put these files by typing in `cd path/to/the/folder`.

## Setup
Once you have the repo, type in the command `npm ci`, then type in `npx ng serve`.  This will get the dev build running.
